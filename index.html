    <h1>About me</h1>
      <p>Hello, I am an aspiring programmer of 38 years old currently residing in northern Georgia. I am married and have two children, a 10 year old girl, and 5 year old boy. If I'm not at the computer, you can find me playing guitar, battling beyblades with my kids, or keeping our 2 lovely cats from destroying the house.</p>
      <h3><span class="highlight">Background</span></h3>
        <p>I graduated from Kennesaw State University in 2006 with a BA in Management. Since then I have worked for several small companies including a start up venture, and corporate with Norfolk Southern Railroad. The last 4 years I have enjoyed the experience of being a stay-at-home dad. As my children have aged, it is now time for me to start a new season of life which has led me to programming bootcamp with Epicodus. Programming is a skill I have been interested in since high school where I first learned Q Basic and HTML, and I'm looking forward to this new journey of becoming a developer.</p>
